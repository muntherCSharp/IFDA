Image Forgery Detection and Authentication

This project focuses on developing robust algorithms for detecting and authenticating digital image forgeries. Leveraging techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and digital forensics, the goal is to address the critical need for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital images in various domains.

Key Features:

Forgery Detection: Implement state-of-the-art algorithms to detect various types of image forgeries, including copy-shifting, linking, and redaction.
Authentication Techniques: Develop authentication techniques to verify the integrity and authenticity of digital images, such as digital watermarking and cryptographic hashing.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions using quantitative metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Dataset: Utilize datasets like MICC-F220 and FVC2004 for training and testing the algorithms.

Why This Project?

With the increasing prevalence of digital image manipulation and the rise of fake news, there is a growing need for reliable methods to detect and authenticate digital image content. This project aims to contribute to the development of such methods and enhance trust in digital media.
